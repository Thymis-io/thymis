##  Overview

Thymis is an open-source project that aims to provide a seamless and secure IoT device management solution. With Thymis, users can easily configure and manage their devices running on the NixOS operating system.

Thymis does this by allowing users to define and configure their device state and generating NixOS configurations for their devices.
The controller can build device images as well as deploy to live devices.

Thymis also exposes a API that enables CRUD operations on device and module data.

Visit the [Thymis Website](https://thymis.io) for more information.

---

## Architecture

The project uses SvelteKit for the frontend and FastAPI for a device controller. The frontend communicates with the controller using a REST API. The controller is responsible for managing device and module data.

## Documentation

The projects documentation is in a TODO state. It is mainly documented by code comments and explanations in the codebase. We are working on pretty docs for you.
