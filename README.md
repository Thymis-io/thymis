##  Overview

Key features of Thymis include:

- **Device Provisioning**: Easily provision new devices with pre-configured system images.
- **Device Configuration**: Configure devices using a web-based interface.
- **Device Management**: Monitor device status, manage device modules, and deploy updated configurations to devices.
- **REST API**: Expose a REST API for CRUD operations on device and configuration data.
- **[NixOS](https://nixos.org/) Integration**: Leverage the power of NixOS for declarative system configuration.
    - **[nixpkgs](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs)**: According to [Repology](https://repology.org/repositories/statistics/newest), nixpkgs has over 60000 packages with the latest version available. This makes it the largest collection of up-to-date software packages available for any Linux distribution. You can use any of these packages in your Thymis project.
    - Deployments without wasted bandwidth: Only changed paths are sent to the device, reducing the amount of data sent over the network.
    - Deployments without downtime: The device is updated atomically, ensuring that the device is always in a consistent state.
    - Rollbacks: If the device fails to boot after an update, the device can be rolled back to the previous state.
    - Reproducible builds: The same configuration will always produce the same result, ensuring that the device is always in a consistent state.
    - Air-gapped deployments: Devices can be updated without needing to connect to the internet. Only a connection to the Thymis controller is required. Deployments using Mass Storage is possible but not yet implemented.
- **Device tagging**: Tag devices to group them together for easier management.

## Architecture

The project uses SvelteKit for the frontend and FastAPI for a device controller. The frontend communicates with the controller using a REST API. The controller is responsible for managing device and module data.

## Documentation

The projects documentation is in a TODO state. It is mainly documented by code comments and explanations in the codebase. We are working on pretty docs for you.

##  Getting Started

***Requirements***

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed on your system:

* **Nix**
* **Python 3**
* **Node.js**

###  Installation

1. Clone the thymis repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Thymis-io/thymis
```

2. Change to the project directory:

```sh
cd thymis
```

3. Install the dependencies:

```sh
cd frontend
npm install
cd ../controller
poetry install
```

###  Running `thymis`

Use the following command to run thymis:

```sh
cd controller
poetry run uvicorn thymis_controller.main:app --reload
```

The controller takes care of running the frontend for you. You can access thymis at `http://localhost:8000`.
