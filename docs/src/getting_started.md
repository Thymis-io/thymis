# Getting Started

In order to get started with Thymis, you need to access a running Thymis controller. The controller is the component of Thymis that generates, deploys, and manages IoT devices.

Currently, the Thymis controller can be easily deployed using a [NixOS](https://nixos.org/) module.
See the [Thymis NixOS module](./getting_started/nixos.md) for instructions on deploying the controller.

## For developers

See the [GitHub Readme](https://github.com/Thymis-io/thymis#getting-started) for instructions on setting up Thymis for development.
