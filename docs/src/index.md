# Introduction

Welcome to the Thymis documentation! This documentation is intended to help you get started with Thymis on your devices.

Thymis is a project that allows you to generate, deploy, and manage your own IoT devices.
It is based on [NixOS](https://nixos.org/), a Linux distribution that is built around the Nix package manager.

The component of Thymis that generates, deploys, and manages IoT devices is called the Thymis-Controller.

Thymis Enterprise is a commercial version of Thymis that allows you to generate, deploy, and manage devices on multiple machines.
Getting started with Thymis Enterprise is similar to getting started with Thymis, but there are some additional steps that you need to take.
If you are interested in Thymis Enterprise, please contact us at [https://thymis.io](https://thymis.io).

Get started with Thymis by following the instructions in the [Getting Started](getting_started.md) section.
