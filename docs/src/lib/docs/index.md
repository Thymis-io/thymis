# Introduction

Welcome to the Thymis documentation! This documentation is intended to help you get started with Thymis on your devices.

Thymis is a project that allows you to generate, deploy, and manage your own IoT devices.
It is based on [NixOS](https://nixos.org/), a Linux distribution that is built around the Nix package manager.

The component of Thymis that generates, deploys, and manages IoT devices is called the Thymis-Controller.
