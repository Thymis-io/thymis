# Reference

This section collects detailed background information, technical specifications, and advanced usage notes for Thymis.
It is intended as a companion to the task‑oriented guides in **Device Lifecycle** and **Your Project in Thymis**, providing precise definitions, architectural details, and UI field references.

Use it when you need to:
- Understand **how Thymis works internally** (see [Concepts](reference/concepts.md) for definitions of devices, deployments, configurations, modules, tags, secrets, and more).
- Learn about [**supported hardware**](reference/supported-devices.md) and how device types are added.
- Review **administration** topics for self‑hosted controllers, such as [Firewall Rules](reference/administration/firewall.md) and system architecture.
- Check the [**UI reference**](reference/ui.md) for what each button and field does (Build, Update, Commit, Deploy, Tasks, etc.).

If you are just getting started, you may not need the Reference section right away — but when you run into a question like *"What exactly is a Deployment in Thymis?"* or *"How do I add VNC to my own module?"*, this section is the place to look.
