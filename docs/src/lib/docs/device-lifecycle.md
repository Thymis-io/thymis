# Device Lifecycle

Thymis provides a comprehensive set of tools for managing the (software) lifecycle of [devices](reference/concepts/device.md).
This covers everything from [initial provisioning](device-lifecycle/getting-started) and [deployments](reference/ui/deploy.md) for rapid prototyping to ongoing [updates](device-lifecycle/update.md) and long-term maintenance.
