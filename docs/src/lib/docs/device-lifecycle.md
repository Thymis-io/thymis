# Device Lifecycle

Thymis provides a comprehensive set of tools for managing the (software) lifecycle of [devices](reference/concepts/device.md).
This covers everything from [initial provisioning](device-lifecycle/getting-started) and [deployments](reference/ui/deploy.md) for rapid prototyping to ongoing [updates](device-lifecycle/update.md) and long-term maintenance.

## Steps in the Device Lifecycle

### Initial Provisioning
The first step in the device lifecycle is provisioning, where you set up your devices with the necessary software and configurations to make them operational. This includes installing the Thymis agent, configuring network settings, and ensuring that the device can communicate with the Thymis Controller.

See the [Getting Started](device-lifecycle/getting-started.md) guide for detailed instructions on how to provision your devices.

### Deployment
Once your devices are provisioned, you can deploy software and configurations to them. Thymis allows you to create and manage deployments, which can include applications, services, and configurations that are necessary for your devices to function correctly.
You can use the [Deployments](reference/ui/deploy.md) feature in Thymis to manage these deployments effectively.

### Updates
As your software evolves, you will need to update the applications and configurations on your devices. Thymis provides a streamlined process for updating your devices, allowing you to push new versions of your software and configurations seamlessly.
See the [Update Devices](device-lifecycle/update.md) documentation for more information on how to perform updates.

### Maintenance
Ongoing maintenance is crucial for the long-term health of your devices. This includes monitoring device performance, applying security patches, and ensuring that the devices remain compliant with your operational requirements.
Thymis provides tools for monitoring device status and performance, allowing you to take proactive measures to maintain your devices.

See [Accessing the Terminal](device-lifecycle/ssh-terminal.md) for information on how to access the terminal of your devices for maintenance tasks.
See [Troubleshooting](device-lifecycle/troubleshooting.md) for common issues and how to resolve them.

### Decomissioning / Replacement
When a device reaches the end of its lifecycle, you may need to decommission it or replace it with a new device. Thymis allows you to manage the decommissioning process, ensuring that a new device can be provisioned and configured to take over the role of the old device.
This includes transferring configurations, applications, and any necessary data to the new device.
Simply follow the [Getting Started guide from the downloading the system image step](device-lifecycle/getting-started.md#3-download-the-system-image) to provision a new device and apply the necessary configurations.
