# Configuration

Settings are organized into two concepts: [Configuration](/reference/devices/concepts/configuration.md) and [Tags](/reference/devices/concepts/tag.md).
- A configuration defines the full set of settings that a device should have
- Tags allow sharing the same settings to be shared between multiple configurations

Multiple [devices](/reference/devices/concepts/device.md) can run with the same configuration, ensuring consistency for fleet management.
