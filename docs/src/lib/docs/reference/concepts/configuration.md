# (Device-)Configuration

A configuration defines the full set of settings that a device should have, including software packages, network settings, and other parameters.
Settings are set in [Thymis Modules](module.md), which can be added to a device configuration and configured at will.

[Tags](tag.md) can be associated with device configurations to apply multiple modules to a device configuration.

Multiple [devices](device.md) can run with the same configuration, ensuring consistency for fleet management.

See [Getting Started with Devices](../../device-lifecycle/getting-started.md) for a step-by-step guide on how to create and manage device configurations.
