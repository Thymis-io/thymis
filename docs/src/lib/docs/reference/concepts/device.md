# Hardware Device

A hardware device is any physical device that can be managed by Thymis that can be uniquely identified by a Hardware-ID or by virtue of it being connected to the Thymis Controller at the current time (for example for virtual devices).

A [Deployment](deployment.md) is associated with a hardware device when it runs on it.

## System Images

Device images are complete, customized Linux-based operating systems derived from individual [configurations](configuration.md).

All the required settings can be defined before even flashing a device.
Including kernel parameters, running software and services, and network configuration.
