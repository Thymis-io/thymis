# Thymis Cloud

Thymis Cloud is the easiest way to get started with Thymis.
Check out [Pricing](https://thymis.io/pricing) for available plans.

Your devices don't need full internet access.
Only an outbound HTTP(S) connection to `A_CUSTOM_DOMAIN.thymis.cloud` is required, which will be upgraded to a WebSocket connection. They work seamlessly behind NAT without requiring any inbound ports.
Full network configuration is described in the [Firewall](../reference/administration/firewall.md) documentation.

## Getting Access

1. Register for an account at https://thymis.cloud/onboarding
2. After providing your details, youâ€™ll receive access to your Thymis Controller
