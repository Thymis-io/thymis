# OCI-Container / Docker (coming soon)

Thymis will soon support running in an OCI-Container or Docker container, allowing for a more flexible and portable deployment option.

This setup will enable you to run Thymis in a containerized environment, making it easier to deploy and manage Thymis on various platforms.

If you are interested in this setup, please check back later for updates on the documentation and instructions on how to set it up or send us a message to let us know you are interested in this feature.

For now, we recommend using [NixOS](nixOS.md) for self-hosting Thymis, as it provides a simple and reproducible way to set up the Thymis Controller and its dependencies.
